# Challenges
My solutions for Project Euler, SPOJ, 99 problems in Haskell, etc

Some highlights, in my opinion, are:
- Game of Life implementation in Clojure: `life.clj`
- Solution to Euler #19: `/Project Euler/P019`
- Solution to Euler #22: `/Project Euler/P022`
- Extended Numbers Script: `/Random Exercises/Extended Numbers`
