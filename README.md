# Challenges
My solutions for Project Euler, SPOJ, 99 problems in Haskell, etc

Some highlights, in my opinion, are:
- Game of Life implementation in Clojure: `life.clj`
- DFA executer in Clojure: `dfa.clj`
- Solution to Euler #19: `/euler/p019`
- Solution to Euler #22: `/euler/p022`
- Extended Numbers Script: `/random/extended`
